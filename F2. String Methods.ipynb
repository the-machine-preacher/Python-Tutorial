    "Excellent work! This lesson has shown you the vast variety of string methods and their power. Whatever the problem you are trying to solve, if you are working with strings then string methods are likely going to be part of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Over this lesson you’ve learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .upper(), .title(), and .lower() adjust the casing of your string.\n",
    "    .split() takes a string and creates a list of substrings.\n",
    "    .join() takes a list of strings and creates a string.\n",
    "    .strip() cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.\n",
    "    .replace() replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.\n",
    "    .find() searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.\n",
    "    .format() and f-strings allow you to interpolate a string with variables.\n",
    "    .count() returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of some substring in a given range of indices\n",
    "    .encode() encodes a string into a bytes object\n",
    "    .startswith() and .endswith() methods are useful if you need to check whether a string is a prefix or a suffix of another string\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Well I’ve been stringing you along for long enough, let’s get some more practice in!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>*Exercise:*\n",
    "<br/>A. *Preserve the Verse* has one final task for you. They have delivered you a string that contains a list of poems, titled `highlighted_poems`, they want to highlight on the site, but they need your help to parse the string into something that can display the name, title, and publication date of the highlighted poems on the site. The information for each poem is separated by commas, and within this information is the title of the poem, the author, and the date of publication. Start by splitting `highlighted_poems` at the commas and saving it to `highlighted_poems_list` and print it."
