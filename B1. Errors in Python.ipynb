    "The story goes that on September 9th, 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper found a moth in the Harvard Mark II computer‚Äôs logbook and reported the world‚Äôs first literal computer bug. However, the term ‚Äúbug,‚Äù in the sense of technical error, dates back at least to 1878 and with Thomas Edison.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Python refers to the mistakes within the program as *errors* and will point to the location where an error occurred with a `^` character. When programs throw errors that we didn‚Äôt expect to encounter, we call those errors *bugs*. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces bugs *debugging*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>During your programming journey, you are destined to encounter innumerable red errors. Some even say that 75% of development time is spent on debugging. But what makes a programmer successful isn‚Äôt avoiding errors, it‚Äôs knowing how to solve them. And a good place to start is understanding what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>In Python, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but here are some common ones:\n",
    "- `SyntaxError`: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language\n",
    "- `NameError`: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown\n",
    "- `TypeError`: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>In this mini-lesson, we will be looking at these different error messages, and you‚Äôll get some practice by debugging them one by one!"

    "Finding bugs is a huge part of a programmer‚Äôs life. Don‚Äôt be intimidated by them! In fact, errors in your code mean you‚Äôre trying to do something cool.\n",

    "<br/>In this lesson, we have learned about the three types of Python errors:\n",
    "- `SyntaxError`: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language\n",
    "- `NameError`: Errors reported when the interpreter detects an object that is unknown\n",
    "- `TypeError`: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>There is also another type of error that doesn‚Äôt have error messages that we will cover down the line:\n",
    "- `Logic errors`: Errors found by the programmer when the program isn‚Äôt doing what it is intending to do\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Remember, [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are a programmer‚Äôs BFFs (best friends forever) in situations where an error is giving you a lot of trouble.\n",
