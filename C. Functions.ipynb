    "In programming, as we start to write bigger and more complex programs, one thing we will start to notice is we will often have to repeat the same set of steps in many different places in our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Let’s imagine we were building an application to help people plan trips! When using a trip planning application we can say a simple procedure could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Establish your origin and destination\n",
    "    2. Calculate the distance/route\n",
    "    3. Return the best route to the user\n",
    " \n",
    "<br/>We will perform these three steps every time users have to travel between two points using our trip application. In our programs, we could rewrite the same procedures over and over (and over) for each time we want to travel, but there’s a better way! Python gives us a useful concept called *functions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>Functions are a convenient way to group our code into reusable blocks. A function contains a sequence of steps that can be performed repeatedly throughout a program without having to repeat the process of writing the same code again.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>In this lesson, we are going to explore the idea of a function by slowly building out a Python program for our trip planning steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>At the end of this lesson, you’ll know how to:\n",
    "- Write a function and return values from it\n",
    "- Allow functions to take custom input\n",
    "- Experiment with how functions access our other python code\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>And much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>*Exercise:*\n",
    "<br/>In this lesson we will be building a function called `navigation_steps()`. It will serve as a container for the three steps discussed above in the navigation procedure and can be reused across multiple users as they plan their trips to different locations. The basic algorith is as follows:\n",
    "- Establish your starting & end points\n",
    "- Calculate the distance/route\n",

    "Excellent work! 👏 In this lesson, you’ve covered a major fundamental programming concept used in the majority of all programs to organize code into reusable blocks. To recap, we explored:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. What problems arise in our programs without functions\n",
    "    2. What functions are and how to write them\n",
    "    3. How whitespace plays an important role in how a program will execute our code and more importantly distinguish function code from non-function code\n",
    "    4. How to pass input values into our functions using parameters and arguments\n",
    "    5. The difference between built-in and user-defined functions and some common built-in functions python offers\n",
    "    6. How we can reuse function output with the `return` keyword, as well as multiple returns\n",
    "    7. Where variables can be accessed in our programs that use functions (i.e. the *scope* of a function)\n",

    "<br/>1. First, like in our previous exercises, we want to make sure to welcome our users to the application. Create a function called `trip_planner_welcome()` that takes one parameter called `name`. The function should use `print()` to output a message like this: `Welcome to tripplanner v1.0 <Name Here>` where `<Name Here>` represents the parameter variable of `name` we defined. Call `trip_planner_welcome()`, passing your `name` as an argument."
