All the variables you create: integers, lists, dictionaries — these are all Python objects, and Python knows how to clean them up when it’s done with them. Since your files exist *outside* your Python script, we need to tell Python when we’re done with them so that it can close the connection to that file. Leaving a file connection open unnecessarily can affect performance or impact other programs on your computer that might be trying to access that file.\n",
